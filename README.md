# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

- A list has been created and python has been programmed to choose randomly from the list using the random module.
- A user input has been inserted to ensure the user guesses one letter at a time and inserts a valid entry which in this case are solely alphabets.
- Another function has been added to check if the letter guessed is in the randomly generated word.
- Two functions have been defined outside of the initial one which breaks the functions inserted into the original block of code - all about validating the input as well as its existence in the chosen word.
